# AlphaFactor-Backtester
### **Summer 2024 Project at UChicago in collaboration with Exponential Tech and Deception &amp; Truth Analysis. This tool backtests fundamental factors using the Zipline-Reloaded framework, enabling robust analysis and evaluation of investment strategies.**

### Set you environment variables
* in ~/.bashrc (~/.zshrc on macOS) set the location of the root folder of the project which will include three different cloned repos and a .zipline data directory.  It is technically an .SQLLite database.
export ZIPLINE_ROOT=/home/morgan/repos/edge-seeker/zipline-x/.zipline
export ZIPLINE_RESULTS_ROOT=/home/morgan/repos/edge-seeker/zipline-x/results
* Add the QUANDL_API key to your ~/.bashrc (~/.zshrc on macOS) 
export QUANDL_API_KEY=tw2sxkKZo_y1UvMcnSux

### Required Installations
To get started, you need to install two additional packages: zipline-reloaded and pyfolio-reloaded.

## New Multi-module git repo - This repo has pyfolio-reloaded and zipline-reloaded submodules
1. git clone https://HighlyUnlikely22@bitbucket.org/exponential-tech/edge-seeker.git 
2. cd edge-seeker
3. git submodule init
4. git submodule update


Old Instructions -- TO BE REMOVED
1. Create a folder called zipline_x
2.	Clone pyfolio-reloaded for analyzing and plotting backtest results. You can find it [here](https://github.com/YuweiUltra/pyfolio-reloaded). This version includes functionality to output plots in an HTML file.
3.	Clone zipline-reloaded for backtesting trading strategies. You can find it [here](https://github.com/YuweiUltra/zipline-reloaded).
4.	Clone this AlphaFactor-Backtester repository.


### Create a conda environment and install repos
Warning: Do not deviate from this sequence or you may have dependency clashes

conda create --name zip_312 python=3.12
conda activate zipline_x_312
pip install numpy==1.26.4

From pyfolio-reloaded:
pip install .
From zipline-reloaded:
pip install .

### project Structure
```
zipline_x
â”œâ”€â”€ .zipline/                  # Configuration and data for Zipline
â”œâ”€â”€ AlphaFactor-Backtester/    # Main project directory
â”œâ”€â”€ pyfolio-reloaded/          # Pyfolio library for performance analysis and visualization
â””â”€â”€ zipline-reloaded/          # Zipline Reloaded library for backtesting trading
```
If .zipline/ does not exist in your root directory, run the following command in your terminal:
```
zipline ingest
```

### Creating a Custom Bundle
Zipline uses bundle data to speed up backtests. Therefore, we need to create and ingest our custom bundle data.

In this project, I used Quandl EOD data downloaded from Nasdaq Data Link. First, I ran a quandl_preprocessing script to store the data in a more readable quandl.h5 file with a unique sid for each ticker. (! This step is time consuming and not necessary if you use data from other source.)

Next, create quandl_custom_bundle.py (the name can vary) and extension.py in the .zipline/ directory.

Your .zipline/ directory should look like this:
```
~/.zipline/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ quandl_custom_bundle.py
â””â”€â”€ extension.py
```
Once everything is set up correctly, run the following commands to ingest the custom bundle:
```
python ~/repos/edge-seeker/zipline-x/.zipline/extension.py  #This creates a folder in which to register a new data bundle

python quote_media_downloader.py  #This downloads the most recent data from quote media and store in /custom_data/quotemedia_latest.h5 file.  Note: it is sometimes flaky and you need to run it multiple times to return the price data.

zipline ingest -b quandl_custom_bundle  #this will run the quandl_custom_bundle.py code to transform quotemedia_latest.h5 file into a bundle that can be read by zipline

zipline bundles #will show the bundles including the one you just ingressed

```
After successfully ingesting the data, the directory structure will look like this:
```
~/.zipline/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ data
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ quandl_custom_bundle
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ 2024-08-15T07:00:21.328524
â”œâ”€â”€ quandl_custom_bundle.py
â””â”€â”€ extension.py
```

### Starting the Backtest 
You can start the backtest by running main.py with terminal arguments for parsing parameters, or you can directly run one of the following scripts:

	â€¢	backtest_DollarNeutral.py
	â€¢	backtest_Parallelize.py
	â€¢	backtest_Decile.py #This is the long-only S&P500 Strategy
	â€¢	backtest_Decile-test03.py #This is the working version with data up through October 2024 (start here)

## Thanks
We are truly grateful to Jason from Deception & Truth Analysis and Morgan from Exponential Tech for providing us with these fantastic datasets and the opportunity to learn so much during this project. Weâ€™re excited about the insights weâ€™ve gained and look forward to seeing how these signals can be applied in real-world trading scenarios.

Finally, enjoy the research and have fun! Good luck and happy trading! ðŸ˜„
